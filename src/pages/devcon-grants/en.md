Calling all community organizers! 

As much as we're looking forward to Devcon, it's far from the only place that the Ethereum community comes together. This past year has shown us just how much we depend on community-run events to keep us connected even while we're apart, and we want to support you in doing that crucial work. 

In collaboration with the Ecosystem Support team, we're announcing a wave of small grants, from **$500-1500 USD**, to help cover costs incurred in organizing smaller-scale events such as local meetups or topical workshops. 

### Who {#who}

We want to hear from organizers of:

- Meetups
- Workshops
- Hackathons
- Other community events - creative formats are welcome to apply!

### Eligibility {#eligibility}

To be eligible for a grant, your event should be:

- Ethereum focused
- Free to attend
- Open to anyone
- If held in person, compliant with all local COVID-19 restrictions and guidance
- Not focused on investment, price or token sales
- Events that have already taken place are not eligible

### How to apply {#how-to-apply}

Fill out the form below to request funding for your event. Grants range from $500-1500 USD; you'll need to submit a budget detailing how funds will be used. 

If your event doesn't have financial costs attached, get in touch anyway! We'd love to list it on the [Road to Devcon events page](https://www.devcon.org/en/#participate) and share announcements and recordings. We may also be able to help with other aspects like sourcing speakers or getting access to virtual meetup tools. 

Once you've submitted your application, we'll follow up by email.
